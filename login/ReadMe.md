This is to work with the while loop, if and else statements in python. 

with this script, creating a very simple login where a user is allowed an option of reseting the username and password after the first failed attempt or try 4 times to remember these login credientials. After the 4th attempt, the user is shut out for entering too many wrong credientials. 


The file user_info.py contains the user information. This is the default username, password and secret code created. 

This is how the file_info.py script looks like 

```python
#User infomation

username = 'Maureen'

password = 'Candies'

secret_code = 'Sweets'
```
