This is based on the titanic dataset found on Kaggle. Using the K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm to predict if an individual will survive or not(a binary classification). 

In this task:

1. Data Cleaning 
2. Feature Engineering 
3. Data Encoding(changing categorical data into quantitative data)
4. The Model(K_Nearest Neighbor)
5. The Prediction
6. Evaluation of the Model
7. Tuning the Model
