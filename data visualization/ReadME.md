Building visualization done in Tableau in python. With this task, I used the matplotlib, plotly and the pywaffle libraries to re-build some of the visualization done in Tableau. 

Plotly library is used for interactive visualizations. 

pywaffle library: who doesn't enjoy waffles. Well, I love waffles a lot. This library is used for waffle charts. This chart was created to use the difference between two variables in the dataset used. 

The dataset used was the same used in the Tableau visualization. The data was sourced from Wikipedia.
